Avoiding guessing about capacity Since the cloud is elastic, which means you can scale up and scale down based on your requirements at any time, you can provision only the resources that you need at any point of time. Moving from capital expenses to variable/flexible expenses It becomes difficult to get approval for new hardware each time you want to start a project. With an operational expense model, you have zero up-front costs. Benefiting from massive economics of scale A user of cloud computing benefits from the massive economies of scale since hundreds of thousands of customers are aggregated in the cloud. This in turns translates to low pay-as-you-go prices. Avoiding spending money on data centers With cloud computing you don\u2019t have any overhead to manage the data center, and you can focus more on what the business needs. Benefiting from the pace of innovation Customers can use all the new products and features instantly, whenever they  are released. The moment a new feature is available, it is automatically available to you. Going global in minutes With cloud computing, you don\u2019t have to wait for months or even days to operate from a different region. With just a few mouse clicks and a few minutes, you can be ready to operate from a different region. You can do it almost instantly."},{"location":"AWS/01%20-%20cloud_computing/#three-models-of-cloud-computing","title":"Three Models of Cloud Computing","text":"Cloud Computing Models Description Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) Provides the foundation for a cloud IT environment that includes compute (server), networking, storage, and space in a data center.

Espec\u00edficamente, podemos decir que Kafka act\u00faa como intermediario entre el emisor y el receptor al ofrecer una funci\u00f3n de mensajer\u00eda; mediante este m\u00e9todo, la plataforma tambi\u00e9n es capaz de resolver el problema de los datos o mensajes que no se almacenan temporalmente cuando el receptor no est\u00e1 disponible (por ejemplo, problemas de red).</p> <p>Adem\u00e1s, una cola de Kafka bien configurada evita que el emisor sobrecargue al receptor. Esto ocurre cuando la informaci\u00f3n necesita ser enviada m\u00e1s r\u00e1pidamente mediante conexi\u00f3n directa, para ser recibida y procesada. Kafka se considera una plataforma adecuada incluso si el sistema de destino recibe el mensaje pero colapsa durante el proceso, donde el error es notificado; en casos normales, a pesar del colapso, uno podr\u00eda creer que el procesamiento fue exitoso.</p> <p>Kafka combina tres caracter\u00edsticas clave:</p> <ul> <li>Publicar (escribir) y suscribirse (leer) a flujos de eventos, incluyendo la importaci\u00f3n/exportaci\u00f3n continua de datos desde otros sistemas.</li> <li>Almacenar flujos de eventos de manera duradera y confiable durante el tiempo que desees.</li> <li>Procesar flujos de eventos a medida que ocurren o de forma retrospectiva.</li> </ul> <p>Y toda esta funcionalidad se proporciona de manera distribuida, altamente escalable, el\u00e1stica, tolerante a fallos y segura. Kafka puede desplegarse en hardware bare-metal, m\u00e1quinas virtuales y contenedores, tanto en instalaciones locales como en la nube.</p>"},{"location":"Kafka/01%20-%20Overview/#cuales-son-los-conceptos-fundamentales-de-kafka","title":"\u00bfCu\u00e1les son los conceptos fundamentales de Kafka?","text":"<p>En general, Kafka acepta flujos de eventos escritos por los productores de datos. Kafka almacena los datos de forma cronol\u00f3gica en particiones entre brokers (servidores); varios brokers forman un cl\u00faster. Kafka agrupa estos datos en categor\u00edas llamadas topics; los consumidores de datos obtienen los datos suscribi\u00e9ndose a los topics deseados. Cuando lees o escribes datos en Kafka, lo haces en forma de eventos. Conceptualmente, un evento tiene una clave, valor, marca de tiempo y encabezados de metadatos opcionales.</p>"},{"location":"Kafka/01%20-%20Overview/#que-es-un-evento","title":"\u00bfQu\u00e9 es un evento?","text":"<p>Un evento es un mensaje con datos que describen el evento. Por ejemplo, cuando un nuevo usuario se registra en un sitio web, el sistema crea un evento de registro, que puede incluir el nombre del usuario, correo electr\u00f3nico, contrase\u00f1a, ubicaci\u00f3n, etc.</p> <p>Los eventos se organizan y se almacenan de manera duradera en topics. Simplificando mucho, un topic es similar a una carpeta en un sistema de archivos, y los eventos son los archivos en esa carpeta. Los topics en Kafka siempre son multi-productor y multi-suscriptor: un topic puede tener cero, uno o muchos productores que escriben eventos en \u00e9l, as\u00ed como cero, uno o muchos consumidores que se suscriben a estos eventos.</p> <p>Los eventos en un topic se pueden leer tantas veces como sea necesario, a diferencia de los sistemas de mensajer\u00eda tradicionales, los eventos no se eliminan despu\u00e9s de ser consumidos. En su lugar, se define cu\u00e1nto tiempo debe retener Kafka tus eventos a trav\u00e9s de una configuraci\u00f3n por topic, despu\u00e9s de lo cual los eventos antiguos ser\u00e1n descartados.

Generalmente act\u00faan como consumidores de datos, almacenando o analizando los datos que reciben de Kafka.

Los productores publican estos eventos en los topics de Kafka mientras que los consumidores se suscriben a los topics para acceder a los datos deseados. Tomando nuevamente el ejemplo del registro, la informaci\u00f3n sobre el \"nuevo usuario\" se publica (a trav\u00e9s de Kafka) en el topic de \"registro\". Los suscriptores, a su vez, consumen eventos del topic de \"registro\" y lo utilizan junto con otros datos como base para la prestaci\u00f3n de sus productos o servicios.</p> <p>Una partici\u00f3n es donde los datos se almacenan en Kafka y sirve para dividir la informaci\u00f3n recibida en funci\u00f3n del topic correspondiente.</p> <p>Los topics est\u00e1n particionados, lo que significa que un topic se distribuye en varios \"buckets\" ubicados en diferentes brokers de Kafka. Esta distribuci\u00f3n de tus datos es muy importante para la escalabilidad porque permite que las aplicaciones cliente tanto lean como escriban datos desde/hacia muchos brokers al mismo tiempo. Cuando se publica un nuevo evento en un topic, en realidad se a\u00f1ade a una de las particiones del topic. Los eventos con la misma clave de evento se escriben en la misma partici\u00f3n, y Kafka garantiza que cualquier consumidor de una partici\u00f3n dada siempre leer\u00e1 los eventos de esa partici\u00f3n en exactamente el mismo orden en que fueron escritos.</p> <p>Los consumidores trabajan como parte de un grupo de consumidores, que es uno o m\u00e1s consumidores que trabajan juntos para consumir un topic. El grupo asegura que cada partici\u00f3n sea consumida solo por un miembro.
